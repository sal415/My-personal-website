        <p>My name is Salman Doria. I am currently 18 and I live in Queens in <button id="nyc"> New York City</button>. My love for coding had started when I first started playing video games and because of this I knew I wanted to learn coding to be able to create my own game. As I got older I realized there were many things I can create as a developer besides games such as websites or web applications. I had gone to City College and tried to acquire a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. During that time, I was learning some python by myself but it was difficult to figure out everything on my own and so I had family and friends recommend that I do a bootcamp so I would be able to learn in an interactive way. During summer,I looked into the bootcamp option and I applied because I would be able to learn what I want in a fast-paced and interactive way. Some hobbies I have are playing video games and basketball as well as reselling limited sneakers. </p>
